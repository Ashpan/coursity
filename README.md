## What is this?
Remember that time when you meticulously added all your course lectures, labs, and tutorials to your phone or laptop? We all do. Almost every student goes through this once per semester unless your university is smart enough to give you a way to do this already. This is where we come in. We developed Coursity so that students at our universities didn't have to go through this mentally exhausting process anymore! In three simple steps, you get a file you can import into anything that supports ICS files...which is basically everything nowadays.

Here are the three steps: Pick your university, paste your timetable, press submit and that's it! You have the file. Open it up on your phone or laptop, it should automatically detect that it is a calendar file and give you the option to import it into the device calendar itself or to some third party service like Google Calendar.

## What the hell is an ICS file?
Good question! Simply put, it's a file which stores a bunch of events. That's it! When you import this file to a device or service that supports it, it takes those events and puts them in its calendar. In our case, those events are your lectures, labs and tutorials. If you have any more questions, feel free to message us!

## It's not working for me, what do I do?
The most common problem we see is that people usually don't copy the whole page or they leave out details that we need to process your timetable. To avoid this, go to the timetable page and simply press Command+A or CTRL+A to select EVERYTHING on the page. Paste that into the Coursity textarea and press submit! If it still doesn't work, make sure you're copying from the correct page. 

When in doubt, re-read the steps and click on the links provided in the steps!
